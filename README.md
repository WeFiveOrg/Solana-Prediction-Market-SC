# Solana Prediction Market Smart Contract

## Feature

### Create Your Own Take(Market) (Opinion-Based)
Anyone can launch a take(market) representing a binary opinion or prediction (e.g., "Will Bitcoin hit $100k by 2026?").

### Dual Token Bonding Curves(Agree & Disagree)
Each market spawns two tokens: Agree and Disagree, each backed by its own bonding curve. These tokens represent opposing views.

### Negative Correlation Pricing Model
The market uses virtual liquidity with negative correlation:
- Buying Agree decreases the virtual liquidity of Disagree, making Disagree cheaper, and vice versa.
- This ensures a dynamic, zero-sum pricing relationship between both sides of the market.

### Fully On-Chain Trading
All trades occur directly on the Solana blockchain. Tokens are never listed on external AMMs like Raydium.

### Decentralized and Permissionless
No gatekeepers. Anyone can create a market, and anyone can trade on any side at any time.
